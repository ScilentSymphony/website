## Testimonials

  

> The skillful nature of ScilentSymphony is immediately evident. But the real treat; what you eventually discover (as you find yourself daydreaming halfway through song 4 of Piano Improvisations Vol. 1), is the soulful nature of these pieces. These compositions represent a creator opening their heart to us, in the finest of senses. These are profoundly touching piecesâ€¦ and you will come out the other side expanded by the experience.

> Magical melodies leading through winding corridors of crystal caves, wire-filled tunnels, beaches inhabited by robo-crabs, rich feasts hosted by cat-peopleâ€¦ This album is full of images.
